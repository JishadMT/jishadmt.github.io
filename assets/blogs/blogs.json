In the <code>TryGetValue</code> method, this search is performed once, combining the key check and retrieval into a single operation. On the other hand, the <code>ContainsKey</code> approach searches for the key twice—once during the existence check and again during the value retrieval—leading to redundant work.\n        </p>\n        <h5>\n            Benchmarking the approaches\n        </h5>\n        <p>\n            To measure the performance difference, we set up a simple benchmark using a dictionary with a large number of entries. The benchmark tests the time taken to retrieve values using both approaches.\n        </p>\n        <p>I created the following class to benchmark the prformance of these two methods:</p>\n    <pre class=\"line-numbers\">\n        <code class=\"language-csharp\">using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;\n        \n        namespace Benchmarking\n        {\n            public class DictionaryUsage\n            {\n                Dictionary<string, string> dictionary;\n                const int countOfElements = 10000;\n        \n                public DictionaryUsage() \n                {\n                    // Initialize dictionary\n                    dictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();\n                    for (int i = 0; i < countOfElements; i++)\n                    {\n                        dictionary.Add($\"key-{i}\", $\"value-{i}\");\n                    }\n        \n                }\n        \n                [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]\n                public void ReadWithoutCheck()\n                {\n                    for (int i = 0; i < countOfElements; i++)\n                    {\n                        _ = dictionary[$\"key-{i}\"];\n                    }\n                }\n        \n                [Benchmark]\n                public void ReadWithContainsKey()\n                {\n                    for(int i=0; i< countOfElements; i++)\n                    {\n                        if(dictionary.ContainsKey($\"key-{i}\"))\n                        {\n                            _ = dictionary[$\"key-{i}\"];\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n        \n                [Benchmark]\n                public void ReadWithTryGetValue()\n                {\n                    for (int i = 0; i < countOfElements; i++)\n                    {\n                        if (dictionary.TryGetValue($\"key-{i}\", out var val))\n                        {\n                            //\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }</code>\n    </pre>\n        <p>And run this program to benchmark the performance as follows:</p>\n    <pre class=\"line-numbers\">\n        <code class=\"language-csharp\">internal class Program\n        {\n            static void Main(string[] args)\n            {\n                var summary = BenchmarkRunner.Run<DictionaryUsage>();\n            }\n        }</code>\n    </pre>\n\n        <p>Here is the result of benchmark:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"text-center mb-3 mt-2\">\n            <img src=\"../assets/images/blogs/csharp dictionary tryget vs containskey benchmark result.png\" alt=\"result of the benchmark run\"/>\n        </div>\n\n        <p><b>Summary of the observations:</b></p>\n        <p>Here I took <code>ReadWithoutCheck</code> function as baseline, where we read directly from the dictionary without checking whether it has the key or not. \n            <br/>(Note: this is the most unsafe way to read value from dictionary, as it is possible that the dictionary may not contain the key-value pair you are looking for, thus throwing an exception)\n            <br/><br/>It takes <b>346 &micro;s</b> to read 10k values from the dictionary.\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <code>ReadWithContainsKey</code> function is more than 2x slower compared to baseline, taking <b>759 &micro;s</b>.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <code>ReadWithTryGetValue</code> function is almost as fast as baseline, taking only <b>387 &micro;s</b>.\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Here, it is visibly clear that using <code>TryGetValue</code> gives a safe code at no additional performance overhead.</p>\n\n        <h5>Conclusion</h5>\n        <p>\n            The results clearly show that <code>TryGetValue</code> is the more efficient choice.

It's a small change, but it can make a big difference in your application's efficiency.\n        </p>"

This is because Git, by default, doesn't detect case-only changes on case-insensitive file systems like Windows. Here's a quick guide on how to resolve this issue using the git mv command.\n        </p>\n        <h5 class=\"mt-4\">\n            Why Git Ignores Case Changes\n        </h5>\n        <p>\n            Git tracks files based on case-sensitive names. But on case-insensitive systems (Windows and macOS, by default), renaming from uppercase to lowercase may not trigger Git's tracking mechanism, as it treats FILE.CS and File.cs as the same file. This results in Visual Studio not showing the rename as a change, potentially causing issues when syncing with remote repositories or collaborating with team members.\n        </p>\n        <h5 class=\"mt-4\">\n            The Solution: Use <code>git mv</code>\n        </h5>\n        <p>\n            The most reliable way to ensure Git recognizes case-only renames is to use the <code>git mv</code> command.
